# Hydrogeology of Kenya

## Overview
Kenya is located in East Africa and has a diverse hydrogeological landscape. Groundwater plays a critical role in providing water for both urban and rural populations, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions where surface water resources are scarce.

## Aquifers
Kenya has several significant aquifer systems, including:
- **Volcanic aquifers:** Found in the Rift Valley region, where fractures and lava flows store groundwater.
- **Sedimentary aquifers:** Found in regions like northeastern Kenya, these aquifers consist of porous sandstones and are vital for water supply.
- **Basement aquifers:** Located in the central and eastern parts of Kenya, these aquifers are found in fractured and weathered crystalline rocks.

## Challenges
- **Over-exploitation:** Rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion have led to over-extraction in key aquifers, especially near Nairobi.
- **Water quality issues:** Contamination from industrial activities and poor waste management has impacted groundwater quality in urban areas.
- **Climate change:** Increased variability in rainfall patterns is affecting recharge rates of the aquifers.

## Solutions
- **Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR):** Encouraging artificial recharge to replenish over-exploited aquifers.
- **Water conservation:** Promoting water-efficient technologies to reduce dependency on groundwater resources.
- **Groundwater monitoring:** Strengthening monitoring networks to ensure sustainable groundwater use.
