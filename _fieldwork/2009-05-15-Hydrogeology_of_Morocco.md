# Hydrogeology of Morocco

## Overview
Morocco is a semi-arid country where groundwater plays a significant role in agriculture, drinking water supply, and industry. The country has varying hydrogeological conditions, from mountainous regions to vast plains.

## Major Aquifers
- **Rif and Atlas Mountain aquifers:** These aquifers are found in fractured and karstified limestone, providing reliable groundwater sources.
- **Souss-Massa Basin aquifers:** Located in the southern part of the country, these aquifers are essential for irrigation and are under stress due to agricultural demands.
- **Coastal aquifers:** In regions like the Sahel and Doukkala, these aquifers are vulnerable to salinization from seawater intrusion due to over-pumping.

## Problems
- **Groundwater depletion:** The intensive use of groundwater for agriculture, especially in the Souss-Massa Basin, has led to falling water tables.
- **Salinity intrusion:** Over-pumping in coastal aquifers has led to seawater intrusion, compromising water quality.
- **Climate change:** Decreasing rainfall and increasing temperatures are exacerbating groundwater scarcity in many regions.

## Solutions
- **Desalination plants:** Morocco is investing in desalination plants to reduce dependency on groundwater in coastal regions.
- **Water-saving technologies:** Promoting drip irrigation and other water-efficient technologies in agriculture to reduce groundwater extraction.
- **Artificial recharge:** Implementing artificial recharge projects to increase groundwater storage in over-exploited areas.
