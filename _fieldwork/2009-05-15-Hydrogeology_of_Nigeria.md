# Hydrogeology of Nigeria

## Overview
Nigeria's hydrogeology is characterized by a mix of sedimentary basins and basement complexes, with groundwater playing a vital role in water supply, especially in northern arid regions.

## Aquifer Systems
- **Sedimentary aquifers:** Found in regions such as the Chad Basin, Benue Trough, and Niger Delta, these aquifers are characterized by significant groundwater potential and high permeability.
- **Basement aquifers:** Predominantly located in northern and southwestern Nigeria, these aquifers are typically fractured and weathered, with variable yields.
- **Alluvial aquifers:** Located along river valleys like the Niger and Benue, these aquifers provide water for irrigation and domestic use.

## Challenges
- **Over-extraction:** Increased demand for water in urban areas like Lagos has led to declining groundwater levels and potential land subsidence.
- **Contamination:** Industrial activities and improper waste disposal are leading to groundwater pollution, particularly in the Niger Delta.
- **Seasonal variability:** Rainfall patterns affect recharge rates, especially in the northern regions, leading to seasonal water shortages.

## Strategies for Sustainability
- **Groundwater regulation:** Implementing stricter regulations on groundwater abstraction to prevent over-exploitation.
- **Pollution control:** Strengthening regulations on waste disposal and industrial effluents to protect groundwater quality.
- **Integrated water resource management (IWRM):** Promoting the use of surface and groundwater resources in a coordinated and sustainable manner.
